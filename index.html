                    <p>I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that Iâ€™m more honest and my words are more beautiful. The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable.</p>

                    <p>I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text.
